======

This project integrates Adobe Edge generated web animation with phonegap. Using https://github.com/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc plug-in to read NFC tags, animation is triggered by specific NFC tags. For purposes of prototyping, no data is written to the tags, and just the unique ID of each tag is used to map tags to actions. The example App runs on Android.
